<h1>Parsing Strings with <tt>split</tt></h1>
</center>

<h2>Parsing</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>parsing</b></dt>
  <dd>dividing a string into tokens based on the given delimiters</dd>
  <dt><b>token</b></dt>
  <dd>one piece of information, a "word"</dd>
  <dt><b>delimiter</b></dt>
  <dd>one (or more) characters used to separate tokens</dd>
</dl>
<p>When we have a situation where strings contain multiple pieces of information (for example,
when reading in data from a file on a line-by-line basis), then we will need to parse (i.e., divide
up) the string to extract the individual pieces.</p>
<h2>Parsing Strings in Java</h2>
Strings in Java can be parsed using the <tt>split</tt> method of the <tt>String</tt> 
class.&nbsp; (
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/StringTokenizer.html"><tt>StringTokenizer</tt></a>
 can also be used to parse a string; 
we won't be covering it here).&nbsp; This just gives a brief overview (and some 
examples) of some of 
the common (and easiest) ways to use the <tt>split</tt> method; for more detailed 
information see 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29">the Java API documentation for <tt>split</tt></a>.
<p>Issues to consider when parsing a string:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the delimiters (and how many are there)?</li>
  <li>How should consecutive delimiters be treated?</li>
</ul>

<h3>When there is just one character used as a delimiter</h3>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>We want to divide up a phrase into words where spaces are used to separate words.  For example
</p><dir><pre>the music made   it   hard      to        concentrate</pre></dir>

In this case,
we have just one delimiter (space) and consecutive delimiters (i.e., several 
spaces in a row) should be treated as one delimiter. To parse this string in 
Java, we do
<dir><pre>String phrase = "the music made   it   hard      to        concentrate";
String delims = "[ ]+";
String[] tokens = phrase.split(delims);
</pre></dir>

<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>the general form for specifying the delimiters that we will use is <tt>"[<i>delim_characters</i>]+"</tt> . 
(This form is a kind of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular expression</a>.
You don't need to know about regular expressions - just use the template shown here.)  The plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) is used
to indicate that consecutive delimiters should be treated as one.</li>
<li>the <tt>split</tt> method returns an array containing the tokens (as strings).&nbsp; 
To see what the tokens are, just use a <tt>for</tt> loop:
<dir><pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; tokens.length; i++)
    System.out.println(tokens[i]);
</pre></dir>
You should find that there are seven tokens: <tt>the</tt>, <tt>music</tt>, <tt>made</tt>, <tt>it</tt>, <tt>hard</tt>, <tt>to</tt>, <tt>concentrate</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Suppose each string contains an employee's last name, first name, employee ID#, and the number of
hours worked for each day of the week, separated by commas.  So
</p><dir><pre>Smith,Katie,3014,,8.25,6.5,,,10.75,8.5
</pre></dir>
represents an employee named Katie Smith, whose ID was 3014, and who worked 8.25 hours on Monday,
6.5 hours on Tuesday, 10.75 hours on Friday, and 8.5 hours on Saturday.  In this case, we have 
just one delimiter (comma) and consecutive delimiters (i.e., more than one comma in a row) should 
not be treated as one.&nbsp; To parse this string, we do
<dir><pre>String employee = "Smith,Katie,3014,,8.25,6.5,,,10.75,8.5";
String delims = "[,]";
String[] tokens = employee.split(delims);
</pre></dir>
<p>After this code executes, the <tt>tokens</tt> array will contain ten strings 
(note the empty strings):
"Smith", "Katie", "3014", "", "8.25", "6.5", "", "", "10.75", "8.5"

</p><p>There is one small wrinkle to be aware of (regardless of how consecutive 
delimiters are handled): if the string starts with one (or more) delimiters, 
then the first token will be the empty string ("").</p><h3>When there are several characters being used as delimiters</h3>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Suppose we have a string containing several English sentences that uses only 
commas, periods, question marks, and exclamation points as punctuation.&nbsp; We 
wish to extract the individual words in the string (excluding the punctuation).&nbsp; 
In this situation we have several delimiters (the punctuation marks as well as 
spaces) and we want to treat consecutive delimiters as one
</p><dir><pre>String str = "This is a sentence.  This is a question, right?  Yes!  It is.";
String delims = "[ .,?!]+";
String[] tokens = str.split(delims);
</pre></dir>

<p>All we had to do was list all the delimiter characters inside the square brackets ( 
[ ] ). </p>

<h4>Example 4</h4>

<p>Suppose we are representing arithmetic expressions using strings and wish to 
parse out the operands (that is, use the arithmetic operators as delimiters).&nbsp; 
The arithmetic operators that we will allow are addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^) and we will not allow 
parentheses (to make it a little simpler).&nbsp; This situation is not as 
straight-forward as it might seem.&nbsp; There are several characters that have 
a special meaning when they appear inside [ ].&nbsp; The characters are <tt>^&nbsp; -&nbsp; [&nbsp;</tt> and two &amp;s in a row(<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>). 
In order to use one of these characters, we need to put <tt>\\</tt> in front of the character:</p>
<dir><pre>String expr = "2*x^3 - 4/5*y + z^2";
String delims = "[+\\-*/\\^ ]+"; // so the delimiters are:  + - * / ^ space
String[] tokens = expr.split(delims);
</pre></dir>

<h2>General template for using <tt>split</tt></h2>
<pre>String s = <i>string_to_parse</i>;
String delims = "[<i>delimiters</i>]+"; // use + to treat consecutive delims as one;
                                 // omit to treat consecutive delims separately
String[] tokens = s.split(delims);
</pre>
